Amsterdam, the Netherlands

##What is the plan:

- 18:30   Meet at Amsterdam Central Station "Restaurant 1e Klas". It's on (the eastern side of) platform 2. 
- 19:00   Eat some of the best Paella in Town in a sober but great spanish restaurant. Located in the heart of the red-light district.
- ~~~~~:  Enjoy some beers, have a chat and share some thoughts.. nothing too complicated.

It comes down to this. *1) eat 2) drink 3) fun*

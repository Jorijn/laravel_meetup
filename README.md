LARAVEL MEETUP
==============

## 20 April 2013
Amsterdam, the Netherlands

Contact: Jeroen Gerits (@jeroengerits / Mobile 06 141 302 75)

## What is the plan:

- 18:30   Meet at Amsterdam Central Station
- 19:00   Having some drinks
- 20:00   I reserved dinner for +/- 15 people at Hanneke's Boom (Dijksgracht 4 : http://goo.gl/maps/Y7w7L)

This specific meetup is a great place to brainstorm and discuss about Laracon Amsterdam 2013.

## How to join the Laravel Meetup in Amsterdam.:
Everybody is free to join, please add yourself to this README and send a pull request.  It is important to know how many people are actually attending (I have to organize some small things).

P.S. - Food and drink are at your own expense.

TIP: Use GitHub's shiny new WATCH option to receive an email when things change. :D

## What is the plan:

This specific meetup is a great place to brainstorm and discuss about Laracon Amsterdam 2013.

## How to join the Laravel Meetup in Amsterdam.:
Everybody is free to join, please add yourself to this README and send a pull request.  It is important to know how many people are actually attending (I have to organize some small things).

P.S. - Food and drink are at your own expense.

TIP: Use GitHub's shiny new WATCH option to receive an email when things change. :D
